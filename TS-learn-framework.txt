1.  ------------------------ TypeScript Basics ------------------------
    - Type Annotations
      - Explicitly defining types for variables, function parameters, and return types
      - Understanding primitive types, arrays, tuples, and enums

    - Type Inference
      - How TypeScript automatically infers types based on values assigned

    - Any, Unknown, Never Types
      - Understanding the implications of using `any` and the advantages of `unknown`
      - Using `never` for functions that never return (throwing errors, infinite loops)

    - Interfaces and Type Aliases
      - Defining and implementing interfaces for object shapes
      - Using type aliases to create custom types

2.  ------------------------ Advanced TypeScript Concepts ------------------------ 
    - Generics
      - Creating functions and classes that work with any type
      - Understanding the benefits of using generics for type safety

    - Utility Types
      - Using built-in utility types: `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Record`, `Pick`, `Omit`
      - Creating custom utility types

    - Mapped Types and Conditional Types
      - Defining types based on existing types and conditions
      - Leveraging mapped types for transforming existing types

3.  ------------------------ Working with Classes in TypeScript ------------------------ 
    - Class Definitions
      - Defining classes, constructors, and methods in TypeScript
      - Using access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`

    - Inheritance and Interfaces
      - Extending classes and implementing interfaces
      - Understanding multiple inheritance and interface extension

4.  ------------------------ Modules in TypeScript ------------------------ 
    - ES6 Modules vs. Namespaces
      - Using `import` and `export` for modular programming
      - Understanding the difference between ES6 modules and namespaces

    - Declaration Files
      - Writing and using `.d.ts` files for third-party libraries

5.  ------------------------ Decorators (Experimental) ------------------------ 
    - Class and Method Decorators
      - Understanding the decorator pattern and its use cases
      - Implementing decorators for classes, methods, and properties

# TypeScript

This guide provides an overview of TypeScript fundamentals and advanced topics, helping you build a solid foundation in TypeScript while preparing you for real-world applications.

## 1. TypeScript Basics

### Type Annotations

- Explicitly defining types for variables, function parameters, and return types.
- Understanding primitive types, arrays, tuples, and enums.

### Type Inference

- How TypeScript automatically infers types based on values assigned.

### Any, Unknown, Never Types

- Understanding the implications of using `any` and the advantages of `unknown`.
- Using `never` for functions that never return (e.g., throwing errors, infinite loops).

### Interfaces and Type Aliases

- Defining and implementing interfaces for object shapes.
- Using type aliases to create custom types.

## 2. Advanced TypeScript Concepts

### Generics

- Creating functions and classes that work with any type.
- Understanding the benefits of using generics for type safety.

### Utility Types

- Using built-in utility types: `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Record`, `Pick`, `Omit`.
- Creating custom utility types.

### Mapped Types and Conditional Types

- Defining types based on existing types and conditions.
- Leveraging mapped types for transforming existing types.

## 3. Working with Classes in TypeScript

### Class Definitions

- Defining classes, constructors, and methods in TypeScript.
- Using access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`.

### Inheritance and Interfaces

- Extending classes and implementing interfaces.
- Understanding multiple inheritance and interface extension.

## 4. Modules in TypeScript

### ES6 Modules vs. Namespaces

- Using `import` and `export` for modular programming.
- Understanding the difference between ES6 modules and namespaces.

### Declaration Files

- Writing and using `.d.ts` files for third-party libraries.

## 6. Decorators (Experimental)

### Class and Method Decorators

- Understanding the decorator pattern and its use cases.
- Implementing decorators for classes, methods, and properties.

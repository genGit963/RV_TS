# **Overview of `any`, `unknown`, and `never` Types in TypeScript**

In TypeScript, handling different types efficiently is critical for ensuring code safety, flexibility, and correctness. The `any`, `unknown`, and `never` types provide unique use cases and constraints.

- **`any`**: The escape hatch from TypeScript's type system, allowing variables to bypass type checking. Useful but can defeat the purpose of TypeScript's type safety.
- **`unknown`**: A safer alternative to `any`, where the type is uncertain, but it forces the developer to perform type checks before using it.
- **`never`**: Represents types of values that should never occur. It is typically used for functions that throw errors or never terminate.

## **1. `any` Type**

## **What is `any`?**

The `any` type disables type checking for the variable it is assigned to. It can hold any type of value, making it the most flexible but dangerous type in TypeScript, as it allows unchecked operations.

## **When to Use `any`?**

- Migrating JavaScript code to TypeScript
- When you're unsure about the type at the time of writing
- Interfacing with third-party libraries or APIs with unknown types

## **Basic Example:**

```typescript
let variable: any;

variable = 42; // Number
variable = "Hello"; // String
variable = true; // Boolean
```

Here, the `variable` can be assigned a number, string, boolean, or any other type without restriction.

## **Implications of Using `any`**

While `any` provides flexibility, it negates TypeScript's type-safety benefits:

```typescript
let data: any;
data = "Some text";
console.log(data.toUpperCase()); // Valid, but...
data = 123;
console.log(data.toUpperCase()); // Runtime Error (no compile-time warning)
```

No type checking occurs, leading to potential runtime errors.

## **2. `unknown` Type**

## **What is `unknown`?**

The `unknown` type is similar to `any`, but safer. It prevents any operations on the variable until its type is explicitly checked. It enforces a developer to perform runtime checks before manipulating the value, thus providing a layer of type safety.

## **When to Use `unknown`?**

- When dealing with values that come from outside the program (e.g., API responses, user input) where the exact type isn't known upfront
- To ensure runtime checks are applied

## **Basic Example:**

```typescript
let value: unknown;

value = "TypeScript";
value = 100;

// Operations on `unknown` type are not allowed without a type check
// console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe after type check
}
```

## **Advantages of `unknown` over `any`**

With `unknown`, TypeScript forces you to check the type before performing operations. This avoids errors like the ones in the `any` example:

```typescript
let input: unknown;
input = "test";

// Compile error until a type check is done
if (typeof input === "string") {
  console.log(input.length); // Safe to use
}
```

---

## **3. `never` Type**

## **What is `never`?**

The `never` type represents values that will never occur. It is often used in functions that:

- Throw an error
- Contain infinite loops
- Have no possible return (e.g., unreachable code)

It signals that a function or expression will never successfully complete.

## **When to Use `never`?**

- For functions that always throw exceptions or never return (like error handling)
- For type guards or exhaustive checks in switch statements

## **Basic Example:**

```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

throwError("Something went wrong!"); // Never returns, throws an error
```

This function has the return type `never`, meaning it will not return a value but instead throw an exception.

## **Another Example: Infinite Loop**

```typescript
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {
    console.log("This will never end.");
  }
}
```

Here, the function runs indefinitely, so it has a `never` return type because it doesn't complete.

## **Expert-Level Insights**

## **`any` vs `unknown`: Choosing the Right One**

- **`any`**: You'd use `any` when you need maximum flexibility and are willing to give up type safety. However, it is better to avoid this in most cases as it leads to potential runtime errors.
- **`unknown`**: Safer than `any`, it enforces checks before use, which is a better choice when type is unknown but needs to be confirmed before use.

## **Advanced Use Cases for `never`:**

The `never` type is especially useful for exhaustive type checking and unreachable code scenarios:

```typescript
type Shape = "circle" | "square" | "triangle";

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape) {
    case "circle":
      return 3.14 * 1; // Dummy calculation
    case "square":
      return 1 * 1;
    case "triangle":
      return 0.5 * 1 * 1;
    default:
      // `shape` here has the type `never`, as all possible cases are covered
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      throw new Error(`Unexpected shape: ${shape}`);
  }
}
```

This pattern ensures that you handle every possible case for `Shape`. If a new shape is added later, TypeScript will throw an error at compile time if it's not handled.

---

## **Summary**

- **`any`**: Maximum flexibility, no type safety.
- **`unknown`**: Flexible but forces runtime type checks, providing safer usage than `any`.
- **`never`**: Used for functions that never return, error handling, or exhaustive checks in type guards.

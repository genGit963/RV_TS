      - Using mixins to share behavior among classes

4.  ------------------------ Functional Programming in JavaScript ------------------------ 
    - First-Class Functions
      - Functions as first-class citizens: assigning them to variables, passing them as arguments, and returning them from other functions

    - Higher-Order Functions
      - Creating functions that accept or return other functions
      - Common higher-order functions: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

    - Currying and Partial Application
      - Techniques for transforming functions that take multiple arguments into a series of functions that take a single argument

5.  ------------------------ Working with the DOM ------------------------ 
    - Manipulating the DOM
      - Selecting elements using `document.querySelector()`, `document.getElementById()`, etc.
      - Modifying elements: `innerHTML`, `textContent`, attributes, and styles
      - Creating and removing elements dynamically with `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `removeChild`

    - Event Handling
      - Adding event listeners using `addEventListener`
      - Event propagation: capturing vs. bubbling
      - Event delegation for efficient event handling

6.  ------------------------ JavaScript Ecosystem ------------------------ 
    - Package Management
      - Using npm and yarn for managing dependencies

    - Understanding RESTful APIs
      - REST principles: resource-based URLs, statelessness, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

8.  ------------------------ Performance Optimization ------------------------
